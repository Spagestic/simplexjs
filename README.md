# SimplexJS
![alt text](image.png)
A JavaScript library for solving linear programming problems using the Simplex method. You can try a live version of the solver [here](https://simplexsolver.vercel.app/).

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Usage

To use SimplexJS, import the library and call its functions. Here's a simple example:

```javascript
import { solve } from "simplexjs";

const result = solve({
  objective: [1, 2],
  constraints: [
    { coefficients: [1, 1], constant: 4 },
    { coefficients: [2, 1], constant: 5 },
  ],
});

console.log(result);
```
